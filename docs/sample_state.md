        `[Verse 1: Lloyd]
          I was making Japanese
          And she's watching DVDs
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          Now I'm driving up the 5
          And she waits till I arrive
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          Everything, that I wanted
          Only gotta drive for the moment
          If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it
          For the moment, but you know me
          You know how I get when I'm lonely
          And I think about you and the moments
          But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

          [Hook 1: Lloyd]
          Foot on the gas
          I'm just trying to pass
          All the red lights
          And the stop signs
          I'm ready to go
          Before I get to The Bay
          Babe, that's a problem
          Because I'm way too scared to call
          And you might get me to stay, and oh

          [Post-Hook: Childish Gambino and Lloyd]
          I don't really mind the drive
          But I think I'd rather die
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          With my hands on two and ten
          So I guess it all depends
          On Oakland, on Oakland
          And I'm nervous, truth be told
          I never saw me growing old
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          And if I married you tonight
          It would probably start a riot
          In Oakland, in Oakland

          [Verse 2: Lloyd]
          Everything, that I needed
          Now that I got you in your feelings
          Everything you won't say, you tweet it
          And a nigga donâ€™t like that shit at all
          So treated
          Can we just roll with the feeling?
          Can we just roll for a minute?
          Wait a minute

          [Hook 2: Lloyd]
          Foot on the gas
          I'm just trying to pass
          All the red lights
          And the stop signs
          I'm ready to go
          But I'm really not ready, girl
          That's a problem
          Cause I'm way too scared to fall
          And I know you choose to stay, and oh

          [Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
          All the girlfriends saying "here we go again"
          Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
          Last one didn't end like it should've been
          Two dates and he still wanna get it in
          And they're saying it's because of the Internet
          Try her once and it's on to the next chick
          X-O the O face on your exes...right?
          And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
          When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
          And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
          I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
          Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
          Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
          So let's try

          [Outro: Lloyd]
          Whoa
          I took off my nine to five
          But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
          And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
          It's iffy, you miss me
          I got furniture to move
          And we'll both be thirty soon
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          In Oakland, in Oakland
          In Oakland, in Oakland`
